# mlflow_track_server

This project uses **MLflow UI** to track, manage, and deploy machine learning models efficiently. Instead of manually keeping track of different experiments and model versions, MLflow makes everything **organized and reproducible** in one place 

### 🔹 What MLflow UI Does for my project [MLOps-Salary-project](https://github.com/Senan25/MLOps-Salary-project)

- **Track Experiments** 📝 – Every model run is logged with metrics, parameters, and artifacts. No more guessing which experiment performed best! 
- **Model Registry** 📦 – We store, version, and manage models here, so we can easily move them from **development → staging → production**
- **Artifact Storage** 📁 – MLflow saves logs, model files, and outputs, making it easy to check past results
- **Deployment** 🚀 – Models can be **served directly** from MLflow when ready for production
- **Reproducibility** 🔄 – Tracks code, dependencies, and environment for every run, so experiments are always reproducible
